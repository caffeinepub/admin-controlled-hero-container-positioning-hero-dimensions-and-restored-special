  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to FooterManager.tsx and metadata files, but lacks evidence of a complete Version 59 reversion. The FooterManager changes appear to address the footer settings error (REQ-2), but there is no evidence of reverting all code to Version 59 state (REQ-1).",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Revert all code changes to match Version 59 exactly, restoring the previous working state before Version 60 was deployed",
      "reason": "The diff shows only 3 modified files with no evidence of a comprehensive reversion. A complete Version 59 revert would require showing changes across all files that were modified in Version 60. The diff contains only FooterManager updates and metadata changes, which suggests incremental fixes rather than a full reversion.",
