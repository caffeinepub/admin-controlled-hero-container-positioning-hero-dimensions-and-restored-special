# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix footer settings error and improve admin panel mobile responsiveness.

**Planned changes:**
- Fix the error that occurs when opening footer settings in the admin panel
- Make footer section headings consistent with the rest of the UI styling and typography
- Fix the admin panel settings menu layout in mobile mode to prevent crowding and overlapping of section options

**User-visible outcome:** Users can access footer settings without errors, footer headings match the overall UI design, and the admin panel navigation works smoothly on mobile devices without overlapping or crowded elements.
