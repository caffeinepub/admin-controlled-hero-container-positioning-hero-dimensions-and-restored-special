  "summary": "Implemented rich-text blog editing/rendering, footer hash-route handling, and multiple hero effect layers with theme normalization/clamping. Duplicate-review mitigation is added on the frontend (submission guard + UI dedupe), but backend idempotency for retried create-review requests is not evidenced in the diff summary. Several additional UI/admin enhancements (social media, clinics booking URL, editable footer fields, review carousel settings) appear beyond the stated requirements.",
