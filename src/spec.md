# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix page loading failure and synchronize footer background animation with hero section effects.

**Planned changes:**
- Diagnose and resolve the issue preventing page content from loading (investigate React rendering errors, query failures, component mounting issues, or authentication problems)
- Update Footer component to use the same background animation system as the hero section (particle/motion/vector effects)
- Ensure footer animation respects the current hero theme settings stored in the backend

**User-visible outcome:** The page loads successfully with all content visible, and the footer displays animated background effects matching the hero section's visual style.
